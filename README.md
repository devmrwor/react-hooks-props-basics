# Props Basics

## Learning Goals

- Use props to make reusable component templates
- Understand how props are passed to a component

## Overview

We'll take the next step with React components and examine how they can be used
as dynamic templates by using **props**.

## Introduction

As the building blocks of React applications, components are _dynamic_, in that
they can describe a **template** of HTML and fill in variable data. This lesson
builds a real example of a blogging application to illustrate dynamic
components.

We will use the following components:

- `BlogContent` - contains the content of the blog post
- `Comment` - contains one user's comment
- `BlogPost` - the 'top level' React component, which is responsible for rendering both
  `BlogContent` and `Comment`

### Making Components Dynamic

Time to put the **dynamic** aspect of components to use! Let's start with the
`BlogContent` component. The following snippet shows how we can describe
variables inside a component:

```jsx
function BlogContent(props) {
  return <div>{props.articleText}</div>;
}
```

You should see something new in the above code. Our function has a parameter
defined called `props`. Also, inside the return statement, we have this funky
syntax: `{props.articleText}`.

This line is telling React to place the value that `props.articleText`
represents within the `<div>`. Ok, so where does `props.articleText` come from?

### Passing Information

React allows us to pass units of information from a _parent_ component down to a
_child_ component. We call these **props**, which we will dig more into in a
later lesson. Let's see how we can pass information from `BlogPost` down to its
child `BlogContent`:

```jsx
function BlogPost() {
  return (
    <div>
      <BlogContent articleText="Dear Reader: Bjarne Stroustrup has the perfect lecture oration." />
    </div>
  );
}
```

In the above, we see that when we render the `BlogContent` component, we also
create a prop called `articleText` that we assign a value of "Dear Reader:
Bjarne Stroustrup has the perfect lecture oration." This value is accessible
from within the `BlogContent` component as `props.articleText`!

**To create props, we write them the same way as writing attributes for an HTML
tag.** For example, to assign a `<div>` an id, we give it an attribute:

```html
<div id="card">Hello!</div>
```

To assign a **prop** to a **component**, we use the same syntax:

```jsx
function ParentComponent() {
  // passing prop to ChildComponent
  return <ChildComponent text="Hello!" number={2} />;
}

function ChildComponent(props) {
  // using the values of the text and number props
  return (
    <div>
      {props.text} {props.number}
    </div>
  );
}
```

But remember, this is JSX and not HTML!

One more thing about props: they can be any data type! In our example, we pass a
string as a prop. But we can pass a number, boolean, object, function, etc. as a
prop!

### Props

Let's expand a bit on props here. Taking a look at both of our components will
give us a better understanding of how data can be passed from one component to
another:

```jsx
// BlogPost.js
// PARENT COMPONENT
function BlogPost() {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* BlogContent is being returned from BlogPost */}
      {/* Therefore, BlogContent a child of BlogPost */}
      <BlogContent articleText="Dear Reader: Bjarne Stroustrup has the perfect lecture oration." />
    </div>
  );
}

// BlogContent.js
// CHILD COMPONENT
function BlogContent(props) {
  return <div>{props.articleText}</div>;
}
```

When one component _returns_ another component, this creates a special
relationship between these two components. The component being returned is the
_child_ component, and the component returning that child is the _parent_
component.

The only way for a _parent_ component to pass data to its _child_ components is
via **props**.

On this line:

```jsx
// BlogPost.js
<BlogContent articleText="Dear Reader: Bjarne Stroustrup has the perfect lecture oration." />
```

We are adding a **prop** of `articleText` to our `BlogContent` component.

If we add a `console.log` in the `BlogContent` component to inspect the props:

```jsx
// BlogContent.js
function BlogContent(props) {
  console.log(props);
  return <div>{props.articleText}</div>;
}
```

We'll see an **object** with **key-value pairs** related to the data we passed
down from the parent component!

```jsx
// BlogContent.js
console.log(props);
// => { articleText: "Dear Reader: Bjarne Stroustrup has the perfect lecture oration." }
```

We can add as many additional props as we want, by assigning them in the
parent component:

```jsx
<BlogContent
  articleText="Dear Reader: Bjarne Stroustrup has the perfect lecture oration."
  isPublished={true}
  minutesToRead={1}
/>
```

**Note**: for props that are strings, we don't need to place curly braces around
the values; for other data types (numbers, booleans, objects, etc), we need
curly braces.

And all of these props will be added as **keys on the props object** in the
child component:

```js
// BlogContent.js
console.log(props);
/* 
  { 
    articleText: "Dear Reader: Bjarne Stroustrup has the perfect lecture oration.",
    isPublished: true,
    minutesToRead: 1 
  }
*/
```

Having the ability to share this data between components by passing _props_ down
to a child component from a parent makes our components incredibly flexible! For
example, here's how we could expand our `BlogContent` component based on those
additional props:

```jsx
function BlogContent(props) {
  console.log(props);

  if (!props.isPublisbed) {
    // hide unpublished content
    // return null means "don't display any DOM elements here"
    return null;
  } else {
    // show published content
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>{props.articleText}</h1>
        <p>{props.minutesToRead} minutes to read</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

### Expanding our Application

We still need a `Comment` component that we can use for each comment in a
`BlogPost`. The `Comment` component would look something like:

```jsx
function Comment(props) {
  return <div>{props.commentText}</div>;
}
```

This component, when used, will display content that is passed down to it,
allowing us to pass different content to multiple `Comment` components. Let's
add them in. Of course, with components being re-usable, we can make as many as
we want:

```jsx
function BlogPost() {
  return (
    <div>
      <BlogContent articleText="Dear Reader: Bjarne Stroustrup has the perfect lecture oration." />
      <Comment />
      <Comment />
      <Comment />
    </div>
  );
}
```

...and just as before, we can pass content data down to them:

```jsx
function BlogPost() {
  return (
    <div>
      <BlogContent articleText="Dear Reader: Bjarne Stroustrup has the perfect lecture oration." />
      <Comment commentText="I agree with this statement. - Angela Merkel" />
      <Comment commentText="A universal truth. - Noam Chomsky" />
      <Comment commentText="Truth is singular. Its ‘versions’ are mistruths. - Sonmi-451" />
    </div>
  );
}
```

There is quite a bit going on here. Most notably, we are passing information
from a parent component to many child components. Specifically, we are doing
this by creating a prop called `commentText` to pass to each `Comment`
component, which is then accessible in each instance of `Comment` as
`props.commentText`. Let's expand the HTML that this would ultimately render:

```html
<div>
  <div>Dear Reader: Bjarne Stroustrup has the perfect lecture oration.</div>

  <div>I agree with this statement. - Angela Merkel</div>

  <div>A universal truth. - Noam Chomsky</div>

  <div>Truth is singular. Its ‘versions’ are mistruths - Sonmi-451</div>
</div>
```

...but seeing is believing so let's look at this in technicolor! Following is an
inspection of the _real live DOM elements_ that React rendered when we blasted
this code into a new application (classes, IDs, and minor CSS have been added
for a better visual display):

Alright now! Take a moment. Stretch your limbs, make a sandwich, let the
glorious paradigm sink in. Dynamic components are a core facet of React
programming, and most of what we do as React programmers builds upon them.

## Conclusion

While HTML elements are the basic building blocks of a website, (for example, a
`<div>`), a React application usually consists of several React _components_
combined together. Unlike simple HTML elements, React components are smarter and
bigger. They allow you to do much more and incorporate logic into how content
displays.

**Components:**

- are modular, reusable, and enable a 'templating' functionality
- help us organize our user interface's _logic_ and _presentation_
- enable us to think about each piece in isolation, enabling us to apply
  structure to complex programs

**Props:**

- are passed from a _parent component_ to a _child component_
- can be accessed in the _child components_ via an _object_ that is passed into
  our component function
- can hold any kind of data (strings, numbers, booleans, objects, even functions!)

Going forward we will expand on what we can do with components, how they fit
into the larger React landscape, and what built-in functionality they come with.
